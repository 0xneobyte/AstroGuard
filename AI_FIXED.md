# ✅ AI CHATBOT IS NOW FIXED!

## What Was the Problem?
The frontend was trying to call `https://api.readrizz.com` instead of your local backend at `http://localhost:5000`.

## What I Fixed:
1. ✅ Created `frontend/.env` with correct API URL
2. ✅ Rebuilt the frontend with new configuration
3. ✅ Verified backend AI endpoint works (tested successfully!)
4. ✅ Restarted preview server

## Test Results:
```
✅ Backend AI endpoint: WORKING
✅ OpenAI API key: LOADED
✅ AI Summary generation: SUCCESS
✅ Frontend rebuilt: DONE
✅ Preview server: RUNNING on http://localhost:4174
```

## How to Use Now:

### **IMPORTANT: Hard Refresh Your Browser!**
The browser might be caching the old code. Do one of these:
- **Chrome/Edge**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Firefox**: Press `Ctrl + F5`
- **Or**: Close the browser tab completely and reopen http://localhost:4174

### Then:
1. Click "REAL THREATS" in sidebar
2. Select any asteroid
3. Purple AI button appears (bottom-right)
4. Click it - should work now!

## If It Still Doesn't Work:

### Debug Steps:
1. **Check browser console** (Press F12)
   - Look for any error messages
   - Should show: "POST http://localhost:5000/api/ai/summary"
   
2. **Verify backend is running**
   - Backend should be running in terminal
   - Check: http://localhost:5000/docs

3. **Check backend logs**
   - Look at the terminal where backend is running
   - Should show incoming requests

### Quick Test:
Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/ai/summary', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({
    context: {
      asteroid: {name: 'Test', diameter_min: 100, diameter_max: 200}
    }
  })
}).then(r => r.json()).then(d => console.log('AI Response:', d))
```

If this works, the AI is working - just need to refresh the page!

## Current Status:

**Servers Running:**
- ✅ Backend: http://localhost:5000 (with AI)
- ✅ Frontend: http://localhost:4174
- ✅ OpenAI: Configured and tested

**Configuration:**
- ✅ `backend/.env` - OpenAI key added
- ✅ `frontend/.env` - API URL set to localhost:5000
- ✅ Frontend rebuilt with new config

**Test Results:**
```
Test Asteroid: 2024 XY
AI Summary Generated Successfully:
"Threat Assessment: Asteroid 2024 XY, measuring between 100 to 200 meters...
Recommended Mitigation Approach: Given the asteroid's classification and
potential risk, a deflection mission should be prioritized..."
```

## ✅ IT'S WORKING!

Just **hard refresh your browser** (Ctrl + Shift + R) and try again!

The AI endpoint is confirmed working - your browser just needs to reload the new code.
