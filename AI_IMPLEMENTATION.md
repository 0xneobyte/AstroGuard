   - Appears when data is available

### Backend API Endpoints

1. **POST /api/ai/chat**
   - Conversational AI responses
   - Context-aware (knows current asteroid/impact data)
   - Maintains conversation history
   - Uses GPT-4o-mini for cost efficiency

2. **POST /api/ai/summary**
   - Auto-generates comprehensive threat assessment
   - Analyzes asteroid characteristics
   - Evaluates impact consequences
   - Recommends mitigation strategies

### Configuration Files

1. **requirements.txt** - Added `openai` library
2. **.env.example** - Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` field
3. **setup-ai.bat** - Easy setup script for Windows
4. **Documentation**:
   - AI_CHATBOT_README.md - Complete feature documentation
   - AI_VISUAL_GUIDE.md - Visual examples and use cases

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

### Intelligent Context Awareness
The AI has access to:
- Asteroid name, size, velocity, hazard classification
- Orbital parameters (semi-major axis, eccentricity, etc.)
- Close approach date and miss distance
- Impact simulation results (energy, crater, damage zones)
- Geographic coordinates
- Severity assessments

### Automatic Summary Generation
When opened, the AI immediately analyzes available data and provides:
- Threat assessment (hazard level, risk analysis)
- Key characteristics (size comparison, energy equivalent)
- Potential consequences (damage zones, casualties)
- Recommended mitigation approach (if applicable)

### Interactive Q&A
Users can ask about:
- Asteroid physics and orbital mechanics
- Impact effects and damage estimates
- Historical comparisons (Tunguska, Chelyabinsk, Chicxulub)
- Deflection methods and mission planning
- "What if?" scenarios with different locations

## ðŸŽ¨ User Interface

### Visual Design
- **Floating Button**: Bottom-right corner, purple gradient, pulsing glow
- **Chat Window**: 420x600px, slides up smoothly, dark theme
- **Header**: Purple gradient with sparkle icon, shows asteroid name
- **Messages**: 
  - AI messages: Left-aligned, purple accent, AI avatar
  - User messages: Right-aligned, gray, "You" label
- **Input**: Bottom bar with text input and send button

### Animations
- Button pulse effect (draws attention)
- Window slide-up entrance
- Message fade-in
- Loading spinner during AI response
- Sparkle icon rotation

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Frontend (React)
```javascript
- State management: useState for messages, loading, input
- Store integration: useStore for asteroid/impact data
- API calls: fetch to backend /api/ai/* endpoints
- Auto-scroll: useRef and useEffect for message container
- Error handling: Graceful fallbacks with error messages
```

### Backend (FastAPI + OpenAI)
```python
- OpenAI client: openai.OpenAI with API key from .env
- Model: gpt-4o-mini (cost-effective, fast)
- Token limits: 500 tokens per response (controls costs)
- Temperature: 0.7 (balanced creativity/accuracy)
- Context injection: Dynamic system prompts with current data
- Error handling: HTTPException with detailed messages
```

### Cost Optimization
- Using GPT-4o-mini (10x cheaper than GPT-4)
- Limited to 500 tokens per response
- Only activates when data is available
- ~$0.001 per summary, ~$0.0005 per chat message

## ðŸ“‹ Setup Instructions

### Quick Setup (3 steps)

1. **Install OpenAI Library**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install openai
   ```

2. **Add API Key**
   - Get key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Run `setup-ai.bat` OR manually add to `backend/.env`:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
     ```

3. **Restart Backend**
   ```bash
   python backend/main.py
   ```

That's it! The AI button will appear when you select an asteroid.

## ðŸŽ¬ Usage Flow

1. **Select Asteroid** â†’ AI button appears
2. **Click AI Button** â†’ Chat window opens
3. **Auto-Summary** â†’ AI analyzes and presents threat assessment
4. **Ask Questions** â†’ Interactive conversation with context
5. **Get Insights** â†’ Scientific analysis, comparisons, recommendations

## ðŸ’¡ Example Questions

**Threat Assessment:**
- "How dangerous is this asteroid?"
- "What are the chances of impact?"
- "Compare this to the dinosaur extinction event"

**Impact Analysis:**
- "What would happen if this hit London?"
- "How far would the shockwave travel?"
- "What about thermal radiation effects?"

**Science Questions:**
- "Explain how momentum transfer works"
- "Why does impact angle matter?"
- "What causes the seismic effects?"

**Mitigation:**
- "Which deflection method would work best?"
- "How much warning time do we need?"
- "Could we use multiple spacecraft?"

## ðŸ“Š API Response Examples

### Summary Response
```json
{
  "summary": "**Threat Assessment: 2023 DZ2**\n\nThis 150-meter near-Earth asteroid will make a close approach on June 15, 2024 at a distance of 4.2 million km (11x lunar distance). While classified as potentially hazardous, the miss distance ensures no impact risk for this pass.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\nâ€¢ Size: 120-180m diameter (Tunguska-class)\nâ€¢ Velocity: 8.7 km/s relative to Earth\nâ€¢ Impact energy if it hit: ~190 MT TNT\n\n**Recommendation:**\nContinue orbital monitoring. If future trajectory refinements show impact risk, kinetic impactor mission would be most effective with 5+ years warning time."
}
```

### Chat Response
```json
{
  "response": "Based on the simulation data, if this 150-meter asteroid impacted New York City, it would release approximately 190 megatons of energy - equivalent to 13 times the largest nuclear test ever conducted.\n\nThe immediate crater would be 2.8 km in diameter and 450 meters deep. The fireball would extend 1.5 km from ground zero, instantly vaporizing everything within that radius. Air blast overpressure would cause severe structural damage out to 28 km, and thermal radiation would cause third-degree burns up to 35 km away.\n\nFortunately, this particular asteroid's orbit poses no actual threat to Earth!"
}
```

## ðŸ”’ Security & Best Practices

- API key stored in .env (never committed to git)
- Rate limiting recommended in production
- Error messages don't expose sensitive data
- Token limits prevent runaway costs
- OpenAI's content policy filters harmful outputs

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- [ ] Voice input/output (Web Speech API)
- [ ] Export chat as PDF report
- [ ] Generate impact visualization images (DALL-E)
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Real-time streaming responses
- [ ] Chat history persistence
- [ ] Integration with NASA Sentry data
- [ ] Custom AI personas (Neil deGrasse Tyson mode?)

## âœ¨ Summary

**What it does:** AI-powered chatbot that analyzes asteroid threats and answers questions
